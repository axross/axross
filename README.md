## Interests

- ⚛️ **`UI=F(S)` model**
  - Declarative approach is always better than imperative approach
  - Now UI obtained referencial transparency and idempotence
- 🚀 **Serverless**
  - Most ordinal Web APIs are just a validation gateway for databases behind
  - Cloud functions are more maintainable - easy to deploy/rollback and scale
- 🧼 **Clean code**
  - Your major pie of time on IDE is reading code in fact, not just writing code all the day
  - Logical readability and history trackability is one of the KPI of productivity
